#### how to setup ts live server for java and c++ along with auto complation plugins  

To set up a live server for Java and C++ along with auto-completion plugins in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you'll need to install some extensions and configure your environment. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Install Visual Studio Code if you haven't already.

2. Install the necessary extensions for Java and C++:

For Java:
- Extension Pack for Java
- Spring Boot Extension Pack (if you're working with Spring Boot)

For C++:
- C/C++
- C/C++ Compile Run

For live server functionality:
- Live Server

To install these extensions, you can use the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
code --install-extension vscjava.vscode-java-pack
code --install-extension vmware.vscode-spring-boot
code --install-extension ms-vscode.cpptools
code --install-extension danielpinto8zz6.c-cpp-compile-run
code --install-extension ritwickdey.LiveServer
```

3. Configure Java Development Kit (JDK):
Make sure you have JDK installed on your system. You can download it from the official Oracle website or use OpenJDK.

4. Configure C++ compiler:
For C++, you'll need a compiler. On Linux, you can use GCC. Install it with:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

5. Set up your workspace:
Create a new folder for your project and open it in VS Code.

6. For Java, create a new Java file:

```bash
touch HelloWorld.java
```

7. For C++, create a new C++ file:

```bash
touch hello.cpp
```

8. To use the live server for HTML files (which can be useful for web development alongside Java or C++), create an HTML file:

```bash
touch index.html
```

Now, you can start coding in your Java and C++ files. The auto-completion should work out of the box with the installed extensions.

To run the live server for HTML files, right-click on your HTML file and select "Open with Live Server" or click on the "Go Live" button in the bottom right corner of VS Code.

Remember that the live server is primarily for web development, so it won't directly affect your Java or C++ files. For those languages, you'll use the built-in run and debug features of VS Code.

For Java, you can run your file by clicking the "Run" button that appears above your main method.

For C++, you can use the "C/C++: (g++) Build and debug active file" option from the Run and Debug view.

These steps should set you up with a development environment that includes auto-completion for Java and C++, as well as live server capabilities for web development if needed.
