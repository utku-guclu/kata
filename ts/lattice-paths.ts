// Starting in the top left corner of a 2Ã—2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.
// a diagram of 6 2 by 2 grids showing all the routes to the bottom right corner
//
// How many such routes are there through a given gridSize?

// latticePaths(4) -> 70

/// In this lattice path problem:
// - The starting point is at the top-left corner (not inside the first box)
// - We count paths to the bottom-right corner (not inside the last box)
// - For a gridSize of n, we're essentially solving for an (n+1) x (n+1) grid of boxes
//
// Note: The number of paths in an n x n corner-to-corner grid
// is equal to the number of paths in an (n-1) x (n-1) box-to-box grid
//
// Example:
// - A 2x2 corner-to-corner grid (3x3 box grid) has 6 possible paths
// - This is equivalent to paths in a 3x3 box-to-box grid (4x4 corner grid)
//
// Therefore, our formula uses 2n for total moves, where n is the given gridSize/ possibilities equal with 3x3 box biased versus 2x2 corner biased
